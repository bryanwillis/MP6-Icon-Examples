# MP6 Icon Examples

...


## Method A: Dashicons

The simplest way to set an icon for plugin/theme menu items, are [Dashicons](http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/). Example code in `mp6-dashicon.php`.


## Method B: Custom Icon Font

Using another icon font is easy, too. `mp6-font-icon.php` demonstrates how to do it.


## Method C: SVG as Background Image

Adding a custom SVG as CSS background image is a little trickier. Because [SVG browser support](http://caniuse.com/svg-css) is limited, this method requires a Dashicon as fallback. The example code in `mp6-svg-icon.php` illustrates how to do that and contains a few more details about this method.
